# Verilog-Sudoku-Solver

Verilog sudoku solver based on my non-recursive Java sudoku solver. I am using Quartus and the software requires using the specifications of a device. However, none of the devices have enough pins to enter 81 4-bit numbers so I will work out how to deal with that later. I might do it in rows or columns.
